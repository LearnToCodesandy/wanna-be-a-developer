# Main Goal of this project

* [x] Use images/SVGs to replace icons
* [ ] use API key to fill in the weather data
* [x] attempt a side navbar 
* [ ] develop the graphs as per the previous weeks data

NOTE : 
* since this is not a full stack project and also since only Vanilla js is used, in order to avoid CORS error api is not attempted.
* The same project will be implemented in MERN stack in the near future with full implementation of API.
